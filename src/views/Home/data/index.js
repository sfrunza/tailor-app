      "Tatiana is a very talented and professional seamstress. I came to her with my ballgown wedding dress and she saw right away what alternations are needed and what will be the scope of work. She also gave me invaluable advises on how to treat the dress to avoid more repairs as the dress was slightly used and how to make the dress look better. Tatiana completed the alternations in very short time and the dress was perfect! I also brought other dresses for alternations that I meant to do for years and they also set perfectly to my figure and I could not even see where alternations were made!"

      "Super! Tatiana shortened sleeves on my beautiful Italian leather jacket, taking them in at the shoulder and adjusting the lining so I can't even tell where it was done! Very reasonable charge for such work, too. Highly recommend!"
